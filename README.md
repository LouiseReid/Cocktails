# Cocktails

A cocktail cheat sheet created using the jQuery library.  

Having built JavaScript apps using Vanilla JavaScript I wanted to experiment with jQuery to get used to the syntax and different effects that the library offers.

### To be worked on -

- HTML changed to skeleton set up with all info rendered from a seeds file
- Ingredients placeholders changed to detailed methodology
